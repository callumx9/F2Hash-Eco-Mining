Cloud mining has become the go-to investment option currently, due to its profitability and stability.
It works by allowing users to mine cryptocurrencies through their devices such as mobile phones and laptops.
These are connected through a cloud platform to a mining facility.

Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are decentralized form of digital currencies which are created through the mining process. 
Bitcoin mining involves verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. 
Miners are rewarded new bitcoins for the transactions verified. 
This process requires huge computational power and thus one requires special mining equipment such as ASICs and powerful graphic cards.
With the desire to go green and minimize electricity expenses, mining companies are now utilizing solar energy to power their rigs.
